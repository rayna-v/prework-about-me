      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am a former middle school math and science teacher who has very recently decided to change careers. I am a mother
        to three amazing and talented boys: Everett, age 9; Wyatt, age 8; and Beckett, age 6. We recently moved from Texas as my 
        husband got a Principal Engineer position at Bye Aerospace designing the eFlyer electric aircraft. My family is very 
        supportive and excited about my path to Web Development. We also have a new puppy, Jambi, and a bearded dragon, Darwin.

      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>About a year ago, my family and I moved here from San Antonio, Texas. However, I have also lived in GA, FL, NY, and MI! 
        Colorado is my favorite :)</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>Though I am brand new to coding, I love it; so I consider this my newest hobby. I also love kickboxing, hiking, camping and biking. 
        In my downtime, I enjoy reading, music, puzzles and games.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>I've been dreaming about becoming a Web Developer since I decided to change careers.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I currently live in Parker, CO.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>Though I loved many things about teaching, I feel like I am better suited for a more technical field. Over the past year, I have 
        decided to embrace my penchant for problem-solving and detail-oriented nature while nuturing the emerging technophile within which 
        has led me to the exciting world of coding. </p>
